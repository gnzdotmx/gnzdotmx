🎓 Academic Journey 🎓

I hold a Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Cybersecurity. 
My research revolved around the fascinating realm of Moving Target Defense, exploring innovative ways to bolster digital fortifications against relentless adversaries.

During my academic quest, I embarked on a transformative journey. 
As a special research student at Osaka University, Japan, I delved deep into the intricate world of Cybersecurity. 


💼 Professional Exploits 💼

My professional ventures span diverse territories. 
In 2015, I served as a consultant of Qradar SIEM developed by IBM at an IBM Business Partner Consulting firm. 
My responsibilities included providing expert services in the installation, configuration, and utilization of Qradar, a formidable event correlator that empowers real-time threat detection and prioritization.

🌐 Contributions and Initiatives 🌐

As a dedicated advocate of Cybersecurity, I co-founded a Security Club during my tenure at Escuela Superior de Cómputo (ESCOM - IPN). 
This platform enabled me to share knowledge through courses on topics like Pentesting, Reverse Engineering, Web Security, and Metasploit. 
Additionally, I proposed a research project on Protocol Scrubbers that received international recognition and approval at a prestigious Congress.

🎤 Sharing Knowledge 🎤

I believe in the importance of knowledge dissemination. 
Over the years, I have delivered lectures at esteemed centers, igniting the spark of cybersecurity enthusiasm in aspiring minds.
